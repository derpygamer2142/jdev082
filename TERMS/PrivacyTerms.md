# JaydenDev Privacy Terms
# This applies to all JaydenDev software unless explicitly said otherwise

I strictly state that I prohibit my software sending analytics or any information without explicit user consent. And if information is collected, the user is informed immediately, and the data is viewable to the user. And will limit the use of APIs and libraries if said libraries send information of any kind to a server outside the site. I respect the privacy of users of my software unlike the major corporations and their software. Only when absolutely required will I request a users information. Accounts are used to store user information, since I do not want to behold such information no software will contain accounts or anything to link data to a specific user.
